# Is it cold enough?

These two files demonstrate two Aerobatic.com hosting features:

##  Staging Branch

The staging branch has the working app. Visit http://cold-enough-for-beer--staging.aerobatic.io
See: [Deploy Settings](https://bitbucket.org/ivanoats/cold-enough-for-beer/addon/aerobatic-bitbucket-addon/aerobatic-app-dashboard)

## Express Request Proxy

The Aerobatic hosting platform can remove the need for complex CORS
 configuration by proxying requests to any API service on the web.
  Configuration details are in [package.json](./package.json). Secret
 keys can be secured in environment variables by clicking on
 [Environment Variables](https://bitbucket.org/ivanoats/cold-enough-for-beer/addon/aerobatic-bitbucket-addon/aerobatic-app-dashboard).
